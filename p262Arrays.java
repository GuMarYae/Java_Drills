        // this works though java p262Arrays

        // it says youll want to store the array in a variable so that you can access it
        // later. but i thought i was without adding the "new" smh, java smh
        // ok so you can do int numberArr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 76, 78 }; without the
        // "new" operator as long as you assign each element with values

        //the real way using new is int numberArr[] = new int[#] while # is determining the length\
        //and you doint add any numers to the array
        int numberArr[] = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 76, 78 };
